In other words, write down what kind of data you plan to work with, and what kinds of questions you'd like to ask of it. 
This constitutes your Project Proposal/Outline, and should look something like this:
An anonymous benefactor has a $5,000,000 budget and hired a consulting firm to come up with recommendations for the best places to purchase real estate.  
The firm must analyze at least five markets in the United States to determine if the regions are lucrative investment options.  
Some factors the firm will consider when determining which areas to recommend are: 
ROI, current market conditions, and vacation rental conditions.
